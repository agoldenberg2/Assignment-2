Backend development is the foundation of modern web applications. While frontend developers focus on what users see and interact with, backend developers build the invisible infrastructure that powers everything behind the scenes. Backend systems handle data storage, user authentication, business logic, and communication between different parts of an application. When you log into your favorite social media app, a backend system verifies your credentials. When you upload a photo, backend code processes and stores that image. When you see your friend's latest post, backend APIs retrieve and deliver that content to your device.
